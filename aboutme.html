            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I am Jake Screen, a Computer Science major from Massachusetts. I am
                a huge fan of rock and metal music, as well as play almost every kind of video or card game.
                I have built my last 2 desktops and have helped most of my friends build their own.
                Working on coding whatever comes to mind has always been fun to me.
                
            </p>
            <p><b>Interesting fact: </b>I used to have severe allergy to peanuts, but now i don't!</p>

                <li>Easy access to many libraries and components through frameworks</li>
            </ul>
